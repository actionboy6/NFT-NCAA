    <h1>Our Statement on the settlement of Grant Brace's wrongful death.</h1>
    <h2>By: 35 to First</h2>
    
    
    <div class="card" style="float:left; width:50%">
    <p>This is not an easy task to write, but it is a necessary one. Earlier this week, it was announced that the family of Grant Brace
        has agreed to settle a lawsuit with the University of the Cumberlands for the tragic death of Grant Brace. The allegations made in the lawsuit
        are damning, and are a major concern for anyone who likes sports in general, not just wrestling. We wholeheartedly comdemn the actions taken by for wrestling coaches Jordan Countryman and
        Jake Sinkovics. This senseless death leaves a toxic mark on a community built on trust and sportsmanship. Grant trusted the coaches to do the right thing,
        and they failed miserably.
    </p>
    <p>
        Let me be ultra clear: This was no accident. This was not natural causes. This was not a unforseen medical emergency. This was entirely preventable
        with a fundamental human right being violated. He was denied water. He was dehydrated and asked for water. Not only did they deny him water, they ordered 
        his teammates to not help him. All for a chance to play for a team that clearly did not deserve him. Heat stroke is a very real thing and it must be a top
        priority for anyone involved with physical activity. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Going forward, 35 to First will be closely monitoring any school we deal with to make sure that their players remain safe and looked after. If there is any allegations
        from any school we work with, we will immediately launch an investigation and be sure to keep out community in the loop.
