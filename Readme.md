This is a project requested by Shawn Kalvelage to create a website to allow customers to purchase NFT's of NCAA wrestlers.

I am currently working on a time budget of 4 months with 16 hours per week. I have allocated 2 months for the front end and 2 months for the back end. I am hoping to save quite a bit of time with the front end so I can focus on the back end because that's where I am anticipating to have the most amount of bugs. This ought to be fun. I am going to be using a good bit of code from a previous project and attempting to make tweaks as they come up. 

Update 2: I am now scraping handlebars and going with basic HTML. This is an attempt to simplify the project so I can get this website built. I am in the process of creating a sample of wrestlers on crossmint to implement the collections and create the API key. Client has asked to implement Gauss into the smart contract. I will make an attempt to implement Gauss, however as my skills are still at a beginner level, I am not confident that I can implement it. I am not even certain that I can implement a smart contract. I am thinking that I will have to limit the project to an API call.
