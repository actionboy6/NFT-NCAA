This is a project requested by Shawn (insert last name at earliest convenience) to create a website to allow customers to purchase NFT's of NCAA wrestlers.

I am currently working on a time budget of 4 months with 16 hours per week. I have allocated 2 months for the front end and 2 months for the back end. I am hoping to save quite a bit of time with the front end so I can focus on the back end because that's where I am anticipating to have the most amount of bugs. This ought to be fun. I am going to be using a good bit of code from a previous project and attempting to make tweaks as they come up. 

The current framework I'll be using is handlebars.
