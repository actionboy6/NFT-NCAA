This is a project requested by Shawn Kalvelage to create a website to allow customers to purchase NFT's of NCAA wrestlers.

Update 1: I am now scraping handlebars and going with basic HTML. This is an attempt to simplify the project so I can get this website built. I am in the process of creating a sample of wrestlers on crossmint to implement the collections and create the API key. Client has asked to implement Gauss into the smart contract. I will make an attempt to implement Gauss, however as my skills are still at a beginner level, I am not confident that I can implement it. I am not even certain that I can implement a smart contract. I am thinking that I will have to limit the project to an API call.

Update 2: Client has talked to Gauss. Client does not believe that Gauss will be ready for deployment with cross-mint so he is asking to implement Polygon as a backup. Right now I am setting up a slideshow of various NCAA wrestlers playing. I am having difficulty integrating style.css with the HTML files. Hopefully I can rectify this by the end of next week.

Update 3: Pictures have been uploaded but the js file is not working. So I will have to try and fix that. I am submitting this rough draft for the client to view. Hopefully it meets his expectations, but at this time I am not sure.
